# about the project
this is my part of a final team project for my webdev class in which we have to showcase our skills in CSS, HTML and JS through a small _about me_ page. 
> “This project is to be carried out in teams of 2 students. The aim is to assess your understanding of the course concepts, your creativity and your ability to create a simple, dynamic website. I'll give you a lot of freedom in terms of design, colors and layout. However, it's essential that the site looks good, as many points are awarded for beauty.”

## how i went about it
for my part, i realized having a consistent theme would make it the more aesthetically pleasing and decided to center my page around a pokemon i really like, _jirachi_. before that, i was inspired by a carrd i preivously made to promote my [editing page](https://love385.carrd.co) to ease the creating process. starting from scratch can be extremely difficult at times and because i was working on a tight deadline, i figured i should make the most of my ressources.

since i made the carrd, i had a broad idea of what i _really_ wanted it to look like. not identical, of course, but close enough so i learn a thing or two on web design and CSS. 

## what i learned from it
while it was definitely difficult to start, i learned a lot from this project.
1. **css isn’t as scary as i thought.** having more creative liberty eased the learning process and the overall experience.
2. **css is extremely versatile.**
3. **it's important to properly wrap HTML elements** and label them. the indents certainly made it easier to know where and what i was modifying, but i don't think anything helps more than comments and tags.

in total, this page took me about **12 hours**. i will not procrastinate anything ever again.

## final grade: 104%
